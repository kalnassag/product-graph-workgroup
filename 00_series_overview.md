# Building a Knowledge Graph: A Complete Journey

## Series Overview

This 6-article series follows a real team's journey building a working knowledge graph from scratch. No prior experience required.

We started with questions about what knowledge graphs are and whether we could actually build one. We ended with a multilingual, AI-integrated system that answers natural language questions about product data with reliability and accuracy.

This series is for anyone interested in understanding knowledge graphs—what they are, why they matter, and what it actually takes to build one.

## The Articles

### Article 1: Why Knowledge Graphs Matter — The Starting Point
**What you'll learn**: What a knowledge graph actually is, why organisations are investing in them, and why our team decided to explore them.

**Key concepts**: Relationships as data, flexibility, AI integration

**Key concepts**: Ontology design, classes and properties, relationships, hierarchy

**Time to read**: 10 minutes

**Start here if**: You understand what a knowledge graph is and want to know how to design one.

---

### Article 3: The Hard Part — Data, Tools, and Real-World Decisions
**What you'll learn**: The challenges we faced with real data, how we evaluated tools, and why we chose Neo4j over other options.

**Key concepts**: Data sourcing and cleaning, property graphs, Cypher queries, tool evaluation

**Time to read**: 12 minutes

**Start here if**: You want to understand the practical challenges and decisions in building a working graph.

---

### Article 4: Many Languages, One Graph — Building for Global Audiences
**What you'll learn**: How to structure a knowledge graph to support multiple languages without duplicating everything, and the three approaches we considered.

**Key concepts**: Translation strategies, multilingual design, shared reference nodes, semantic relationships

**Time to read**: 11 minutes

**Start here if**: You're working with international data or need to serve multiple languages.

---

### Article 5: The Conversation Begins — AI, Chatbots, and Knowledge Graphs
**What you'll learn**: How to connect your knowledge graph to an AI system so it can answer natural language questions, and why this combination is so powerful.

**Key concepts**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), semantic search, natural language queries, reducing hallucination

**Time to read**: 13 minutes

**Start here if**: You want to make your knowledge graph interactive and accessible to non-technical users.

---

### Article 6: What We Learned — A Knowledge Graph Playbook
**What you'll learn**: The key principles that guided our decisions, common challenges and how we addressed them, and a simple roadmap for starting your own project.

**Key concepts**: Design principles, phased implementation, quality over quantity, balancing simplicity and richness

**Time to read**: 15 minutes

**Start here if**: You're ready to plan your own knowledge graph project or want a high-level synthesis of the entire journey.

**Total time**: ~40 minutes

### Path 3: Strategic Focus
Articles 1 → 2 → 4 → 6

You'll understand the vision, design principles, multilingual considerations, and lessons learned. Skip Article 5 if you're not interested in AI integration.

**Total time**: ~45 minutes

### Path 4: Design Focus
Articles 2 → 3 → 4

You'll learn how to design a graph, deal with real data, and structure for multilingual support.

**Total time**: ~33 minutes

## A Note on the Content

This series is based on a real project with a real team. The challenges we faced, the decisions we made, and the lessons we learned are all genuine. We've anonymised personal details but kept the narrative authentic.

Our goal isn't to present knowledge graphs as a simple solution. It's to give you a realistic picture of what it takes to build one, what you'll learn in the process, and why it's worth the effort.

---

## Questions?

As you read, you might have questions like:

- "Why didn't you use a triple store instead of Neo4j?" (Article 3)
- "How do you handle updates to translations?" (Article 4)
- "Doesn't AI hallucinate?" (Article 5)
- "Can a small team really build this?" (Articles 1 and 6)

All are answered in the articles. If not, they probably would be worth exploring further in the resources listed in Article 6.

---

## Let's Begin

Start with Article 1 unless you're coming in with specific knowledge already. Each article builds on the previous ones, but you can jump to specific articles if you have particular interests.

Whether you're considering building a knowledge graph, curious about how they work, or trying to solve a complex data challenge, this series should give you a realistic, practical understanding of what's possible.
