# Why Knowledge Graphs Matter: The Starting Point

## What Happens When Data Loses Its Connections

Imagine you work for a retail company. You have product data scattered across systems: one spreadsheet holds specifications, another contains customer reviews, a third has supplier information. Your marketing team needs to find all laptops under $1,000 with specific features. Your customer service team wants to answer questions like "What phones are similar to this model?" Your finance team needs to understand which products are connected to which manufacturers.

Without structure, each question requires manual digging. With a Knowledge Graph, the answer is instant.

A Knowledge Graph is essentially a way of storing information that emphasizes the *relationships* between things. Instead of storing data as isolated records, everything is connected. Products are linked to brands, specifications are linked to products, colours are linked to both products and suppliers. When you ask a question, the graph helps you traverse these connections to find exactly what you need.

This isn't revolutionary technology—major companies like Google, Amazon, and LinkedIn have used knowledge graphs for years. But it's often seen as something complex, only for large enterprises with dedicated data teams. What we discovered is that small teams, with clear thinking and the right tools, can build powerful knowledge graphs relatively quickly.

## Why We Decided to Explore Knowledge Graphs

Our team came together with a shared question: *How can we structure business data in a way that makes it more useful, flexible, and intelligent?* We weren't experts—in fact, only two of us had any prior experience with knowledge graphs. What we had was curiosity, a business problem worth solving, and a willingness to learn.

The appeal of knowledge graphs, we quickly realised, went beyond just better data organisation. There were three things that excited us:

**1. Relationships Matter as Much as Data**

In traditional databases, you store facts. A row in a spreadsheet. A product record. A customer profile. Knowledge graphs flip this thinking: the *connections between* things are equally important. This is particularly powerful for product information, where you might want to understand not just what a laptop is, but how it relates to its components, its competitors, its accessories, and its users.

**2. They Work Well with AI**

As companies explore artificial intelligence and chatbots, knowledge graphs offer something valuable: reliable, structured data that AI systems can actually trust. Instead of relying on an AI system to "guess" answers based on patterns in data, a knowledge graph lets you ask precise questions and get precise answers. This reduces hallucinations (when AI makes up convincing but false information) and improves reliability.

**3. They're Flexible**

A traditional database requires you to decide your structure upfront. If you need to add a new type of data, you might need to restructure everything. Knowledge graphs are more forgiving. You can add new types of connections and information as your needs evolve.

## The Team and the Vision

We assembled a diverse group: some with strong data management backgrounds, some with language and content expertise, some with technical skills. Our shared goal was simple but ambitious: **build a working knowledge graph from scratch, integrate it with an AI chatbot, and make it work across multiple languages.**

We set ourselves some constraints, which turned out to be wise:

- **We chose a domain we could understand**: Electronics products (phones, laptops, tablets). This isn't something that requires deep domain expertise—we could find data online, and most of us understood these products.
- **We aimed for an MVP, not perfection**: We didn't want to boil the ocean. We wanted to build something that *worked*, learn what we discovered, and then iterate.
- **We committed to documenting the journey**: We knew that the lessons—including the failures—would be as valuable as the final product.

## What This Series Is About

Over the next five articles, you'll follow our journey:

- How we designed our first ontology (the blueprint for our graph)
- What happened when we tried to import real data (spoiler: it was messier than expected)
- Why we switched tools and what that taught us
- How we handled multiple languages in a single graph
- How we made the graph answer questions like a chatbot would

By the end, you'll understand not just *what* a knowledge graph is, but *how to think about building one*, what challenges you'll face, and how to make decisions when the path isn't obvious.

## The Bottom Line

Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly important as organisations grapple with information that's distributed, complex, and multilingual. They're not just for tech giants. A team with clear thinking, the right tools, and a specific problem to solve can build something genuinely useful.

This is our story. We hope it helps you think differently about your own data challenges.
