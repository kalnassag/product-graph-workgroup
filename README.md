# KG Workgroup
The KG workgroub started as a group project for some of us who wanted to learn more about Knowledge Graphs and its implementations, specially the multilingual aspect of it.

We started with a mixed group of people who were on oppisite sides of the spectrum, some worked with KGs for years, while others never heard of them, which gave us a unique opportunity of exploration and learning for everyone.
For the KG novices, understanding what KGs are and how they store information was the biggest outcome, for those who are familiar with KGs on conceptual and management level, got the opportunity to learn more about the implementation side and the different available technologies.

This is an oversimplification of the process we went through, for more details, please check the other files in this repository.

We plan on providing the database we created for others to explore, so stay tuned.
